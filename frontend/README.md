# What I Think Frontend

This repository is a Started template for a SaaS application frontend. It is based on Nuxt 3 and Vue 3. This code havily uses the "Layers" feature of the Nuxt 3 to implement a Domain Driven Design approach.

The main feature of this template is its coupling with the [Unified Backend](https://github.com/yooneskh/unified-backend) to make administration of entities easier. Through the code in the `admin` domain and the `Meta` fields exposed by the `Unified Backend`, we have utilities to easily manage the applications entities. Things like `resource-explorer`, `resource-object-dialog` and etc.

Aside from the administration utilities, this template comes with

- HTTP Request Utilities
- Dialog System (In code)
- Form Management
- Toast Message Notification
